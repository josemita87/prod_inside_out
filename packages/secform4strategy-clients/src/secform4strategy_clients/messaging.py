"""Kafka client built on quixstreams.

Pure infrastructure: one client per external service. ``KafkaClient`` covers both
consuming and producing. The consumer returns raw messages as a list of dicts and
performs no field parsing, DataFrame construction or cleaning. The producer
serializes and publishes records the caller has already shaped (keys, timestamps
and any value transformations are the caller's responsibility).
